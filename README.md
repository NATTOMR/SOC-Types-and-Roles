## 🔍 What is a SOC?

A **Security Operations Center (SOC)** is a centralized facility where the information security team continuously monitors, analyzes, and responds to cybersecurity threats.

The primary purpose of a SOC is to:
- Detect security incidents  
- Analyze threats and vulnerabilities  
- Respond to and remediate incidents  
- Protect organizational assets using **people, processes, and technology**

---

## 🏗️ Types of SOC Models

Depending on organizational needs, maturity, and budget, SOCs can be implemented in several models:

![SOC Models](https://github.com/NATTOMR/SOC-Types-and-Roles/blob/main/soc-models.png)

### 🏢 In-House SOC
- Built and managed internally by the organization  
- Requires a dedicated budget and skilled security staff  
- Provides full control over security operations  

### 🌐 Virtual SOC
- No permanent physical facility  
- Operates remotely across multiple locations  
- Flexible and cost-effective  

### 🤝 Co-Managed SOC
- Internal SOC team works alongside a Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP)  
- Shared responsibilities  
- Strong coordination is essential  

### 🧭 Command SOC
- Central SOC that oversees multiple smaller or regional SOCs  
- Common in large enterprises, telecom providers, and defense agencies

## ⚙️ People, Process, and Technology

A successful SOC relies on strong alignment between **people, processes, and technology**.

### 👥 People
- Highly trained security professionals  
- Familiar with alerts, attack techniques, and incident response  
- Able to adapt quickly to evolving threat landscapes  
- Willing to continuously research and learn  

### 📋 Processes
- Aligned with security frameworks and regulations such as **NIST, PCI-DSS, and HIPAA**  
- Standardized procedures to ensure consistent incident handling  
- Clearly defined escalation and response workflows  

### 🧰 Technology
- Tools for detection, prevention, investigation, and response  
- Includes SIEM, EDR, SOAR, and penetration testing tools  
- Tool selection should consider **organizational needs and budget**, not just market popularity

## 👥 SOC Roles

### 🔎 SOC Analyst
- Categorized into **Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3**  
- Monitors and investigates security alerts  
- Identifies root causes  
- Recommends remediation actions  

### 🚨 Incident Responder
- Performs initial assessment of security incidents  
- Focuses on containment, eradication, and recovery  

### 🕵️ Threat Hunter
- Proactively searches for hidden or advanced threats  
- Investigates APTs and evasive attacks  
- Uses manual and automated techniques  
- Eliminates threats before business impact occurs  

### 🛠️ Security Engineer
- Maintains SOC infrastructure and security tools  
- Integrates SIEM with SOAR platforms  
- Ensures optimal performance of detection systems  

### 📊 SOC Manager
- Oversees SOC strategy and operations  
- Handles budgeting, staffing, and performance metrics  
- Focuses on operational and managerial responsibilities
