The primary purpose of a SOC is to:
- Detect security incidents  
- Analyze threats and vulnerabilities  
- Respond to and remediate incidents  
- Protect organizational assets using **people, processes, and technology**

---

## 🏗️ Types of SOC Models

Depending on organizational needs, maturity, and budget, SOCs can be implemented in several models:

![SOC Models](https://github.com/NATTOMR/SOC-Types-and-Roles/blob/main/soc-models.png)

### 🏢 In-House SOC
- Built and managed internally by the organization  
- Requires a dedicated budget and skilled security staff  
- Provides full control over security operations  

### 🌐 Virtual SOC

- Operates remotely across multiple locations  
- Flexible and cost-effective  

### 🤝 Co-Managed SOC
- Internal SOC team works alongside a Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP)  
- Shared responsibilities  
- Strong coordination is essential  

### 🧭 Command SOC
- Central SOC that oversees multiple smaller or regional SOCs

# ⚙️ SIEM and Analyst Relationship

This lesson explains what **SIEM** is, why it is used in a **Security Operations Center (SOC)**, and how it supports the daily work of a **SOC Analyst**.

---

## 🔍 What is SIEM?

**SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)** is a security solution that collects, correlates, and analyzes logs and events in real time across an environment.

The primary goal of SIEM is to:
- Centralize event logging  
- Detect suspicious activity  
- Generate alerts for potential security threats  

Although SIEM platforms provide many advanced features, **SOC analysts primarily focus on alerts generated by SIEM rules and correlations**.

---

## 🚨 Example SIEM Alert

Consider the following scenario:

- A user on a Windows system enters **20 incorrect passwords within 10 seconds**
- This behavior is abnormal and likely malicious
- A SIEM rule is created to detect excessive failed login attempts within a short time window
- When the threshold is exceeded, the SIEM generates an alert

This allows SOC analysts to quickly identify and investigate suspicious authentication activity.

![SIEM Alert Example](https://github.com/NATTOMR/SOC-Types-and-Roles/blob/main/alert.png)

---

## 🧰 Popular SIEM Solutions

Some commonly used SIEM platforms include:
- IBM QRadar  
- ArcSight ESM  
- FortiSIEM  
- Splunk  

To explore alerts visually, analysts can review the **Monitoring** page in LetsDefend.

![Monitoring Page](https://github.com/NATTOMR/SOC-Types-and-Roles/blob/main/monitoring%20-%20Copy.png)

---

## 👨‍💻 Relationship Between SOC Analysts and SIEM

Although SIEM platforms offer many capabilities, **SOC analysts mainly interact with alerts**.

- SIEM rules and correlations are typically created by **engineering or SIEM teams**
- Alerts generated by these rules are reviewed first by SOC analysts
- The analyst determines whether an alert is:
  - ✅ A real security incident  
  - ❌ A false positive  

This process marks the **starting point of incident investigation in a SOC**.

---

## 🔎 Alert Investigation Workflow

From the SIEM dashboard, analysts can see multiple alerts generated from different data sources.

![Threat Dashboard](https://github.com/NATTOMR/SOC-Types-and-Roles/blob/main/threats%20-%20Copy.png)

### Typical Workflow:
1. View new alerts in the **Main Channel**
2. Select an alert to investigate
3. Click **Take Ownership** to move it to the **Investigation Channel**
4. This prevents duplication and helps teammates focus on other alerts
5. Review alert details such as:
   - Hostname  
   - IP address  
   - File hash  
   - Timestamp  

This collaboration ensures efficient alert handling across the SOC team.

---

## 💡 Quick Tip: Handling False Positives

False positives are unavoidable in SIEM environments.

A skilled SOC analyst:
- Identifies false alerts  
- Documents findings  
- Provides feedback to the SIEM team  
- Helps optimize detection rules  

### Example False Positive
- A SIEM rule flags URLs containing the word **“union”** to detect SQL injection
- A user searches:  
  `https://www.google.com/search?q=sql+union+usage`
- An alert is generated, but no malicious activity is present

Sharing this feedback helps refine rules and reduce noise.

---

## 🧾 Final Notes on SIEM

SIEM dashboards provide analysts with a centralized view of:
- Alerts  
- Threat trends  
- System activity  

![SIEM Dashboard](https://github.com/NATTOMR/SOC-Types-and-Roles/blob/main/succesful.png)

Later lessons will focus on **hands-on alert analysis and investigation techniques**.

---

# 📜 Log Management

As a SOC Analyst, **log analysis** is a core responsibility. Understanding how to use **Log Management systems** is critical for effective investigations.

---

## 🔍 What is Log Management?

**Log Management** is the process of collecting, storing, and searching logs from multiple sources in a centralized location.

Common log sources include:
- Web servers  
- Operating systems  
- Firewalls  
- Proxies  
- EDR solutions  

Centralized logging improves efficiency and reduces investigation time.

---

## ⚙️ Why Centralized Logs Matter

Without log management:
- Analysts must query multiple systems individually
- This increases investigation time and error risk

With log management:
- All logs are accessible from a single interface
- One query can search across multiple data sources

In LetsDefend, log sources such as **Proxy, Exchange, and Firewall** are collected under a single system.

![Log Management Sources](https://github.com/NATTOMR/SOC-Types-and-Roles/blob/main/log-1.png)

---

## 🎯 Purpose of Log Management for SOC Analysts

SOC analysts commonly use log management to:
- Check communication with suspicious IPs or domains
- Identify lateral movement
- Detect data exfiltration
- Validate SIEM alerts  

### Example 1: Malware Investigation
- Malware communicates with `letsdefend.io`
- Analyst searches for `letsdefend.io` in Log Management
- Determines whether any internal devices contacted the C2 server

### Example 2: Data Exfiltration Check
- SIEM alerts that a host is leaking data to `122[.]194[.]229[.]59`
- The device is isolated and remediated
- Analyst searches logs to verify if **any other systems** contacted the same IP

This step ensures no additional compromised hosts exist.

---

## 🔎 Performing a Basic Log Search

Log Management allows analysts to query logs quickly and efficiently:

![Log Search Example](https://github.com/NATTOMR/SOC-Types-and-Roles/blob/main/log-2.png)

By correlating log data, analysts gain visibility beyond individual alerts.

---

## 📌 Summary

- **SIEM** generates alerts based on correlated event data  
- **SOC Analysts** investigate and validate these alerts  
- **Log Management** provides the detailed evidence needed for confirmation  
- Together, SIEM and Log Management form the backbone of SOC investigations  

⭐ These skills are essential for any aspiring SOC Analyst.
